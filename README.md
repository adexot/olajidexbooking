# OLAJIDE X BOOKING
![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg) ![Dependencies](https://david-dm.org/olajideoye/frontend-starter-kit.svg)

I set up this project because I would ♥ to work at [Booking.com](https://booking.com). I do hope it's received in good faith and that I'm not breaking any Copyright rules. 

You can find it here [olajidexbooking.surge.sh](https://olajidexbooking.surge.sh)

## Setup
#### Install Node.js and NPM
If you don't have Node.js installed, please go ahead and grab it [here](https://nodejs.org/). NPM is the package manager for Node.js and comes bundled with Node.js

To confirm that you have Node.js installed, run the following in your terminal:
```bash
node -v
```
You should get something like `v6.9.1`.

To confirm that you have NPM installed, run the following in your terminal:
```bash
npm -v
```
You should get something like `3.10.9`.

#### Install Node.js Modules
```bash
npm install
```

## Front-end Development
To continue front-end development on this project run the following in your terminal:
```bash
npm start
```

To do a simple build for production, run the following in your terminal:
```bash 
npm run build
```

To build for production and then deploy using [surge.sh](https://surge.sh), run the following in your terminal:
```bash
npm run deploy
```
